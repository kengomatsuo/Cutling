# Cutling

**Your clipboard, organized.**

Cutling is a native iOS and macOS clipboard manager that puts your most-used text and images one tap away. Save snippets and access them instantly from any app via a custom keyboard extension — no accounts, no tracking, just your stuff.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Text Snippets** — Save up to 100 text cutlings, each up to 2,000 characters
- **Image Cutlings** — Save up to 25 images for quick access (QR codes, signatures, diagrams)
- **Custom Keyboard Extension** — Insert cutlings from any app without switching. One tap to paste
- **Icons & Colors** — Choose from 750+ SF Symbols and 12 colors to organize your collection
- **Expiration Dates** — Set auto-delete dates for temporary snippets
- **iCloud Sync** — Keep cutlings in sync across iPhone, iPad, and Mac (optional)
- **Recently Deleted** — Recover accidentally deleted cutlings within 30 days

### Smart Features

- **Input Type Detection** — Automatically categorizes cutlings (email, URL, phone, name, address) using `NSDataDetector` and `NLTagger`
- **Context-Aware Keyboard** — Shows relevant cutlings based on the current text field's content type
- **Background App Refresh** — Syncs in the background when enabled

---

## Privacy First

Cutling is built with privacy at its core:

- **No accounts required**
- **No ads**
- **No tracking or analytics**
- **No crash reports**
- **No third-party SDKs**
- **Local storage** with optional iCloud sync
- **One-time purchase** — no subscriptions, no in-app purchases

Your cutlings stay on your device — or in your personal iCloud account if you choose to enable sync. The developer cannot access your data, period.
